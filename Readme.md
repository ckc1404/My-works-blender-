# My Blender works 1st Project
Hey, this was my first work when i started blender

This is a donut as u all can see, a simple donut with blue background. But you know what, it took me about a week to learn every single step to actually make it. i have used cycles to render it and applied a bunch of modifiers and texture painting.

The second one you will look at is a basic low poly island that has birds and sun in it. This was also one of my early projects using blender. i have used particle system to scatter the snow and trees and image background for the sky. rest of the things are modelled by me. i like modelling and stuff
