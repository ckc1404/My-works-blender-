# My_Blender_works (5)
Hi everyone, after having a good idea of how to model and texture, i went on to trying animations.

Here are some of the animations created and edited by me as a part of GameD Team, Coding Club, Bits Pilani.

During this phase, i learnt about fluids, clothes simulations particle interactions, about gravity usage of physics and a lot many things.
I also learnt about graph editor and video editor to make these animations.
