Hi, this was the time when i was trying to experiment in Blender,
i used image textures on the ball to make a wallpaper 
and also it's floor which all together gave a lovely effect.

This is a simple ball where i learnt camera effects in blender
Hi, i have added the file as well here for u to look in. its just a simple ping pong ball hehe
